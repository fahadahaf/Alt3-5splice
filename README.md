# Alt3-5splice
Course project for predicting Alt 3' and 5' splicing using SVMs (Colorado State University, Fall 2014).

# Description
Alternative Splicing (AS) is a regulated gene-expression process that is responsible for the translation of precursor-mRNA to different protein isoforms. AS is important because it leads to protein diversity in both plants and animals. AS is relatively well studied in animals but the same isnâ€™t true for plants. In plants, the most common form of AS is intron-retention followed by 3 and 5 site splicing and exon skipping. Because of its abundance, most of the AS research in plants is focused on intron-retention events. However, the involvement of alternative 3 /5 splicing can affect protein coding regions or produce unproductive mRNA that can influence transcript levels. Therefore, it is important to investigate the various signals responsible for the alternative 3 /5 splicing (ADS) events. The goal of this project is to accurately predict ADS events in Arabidopsis by identifying and using a variety of splicing signals and elements that are responsible for the said events in plants.
